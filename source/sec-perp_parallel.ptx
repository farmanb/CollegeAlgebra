  <theorem xml:id="thm-parallel">
    <statement>
      Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
	Determine whether the lines
	<me>
	  -x + 3y=-4
	  \quad\text{and}\quad
	  -4x + 12y = 9
	</me>
	are parallel.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
	In order to determine whether these lines are parallel, we need to find the slope of each line.
	We do this by placing each line into <xref ref="def-slope_intercept" text="title"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
	For the first line, add <m>x</m> to both sides
	<me>3y = x - 4</me>
	and divide both sides by <m>3</m>
	<me>y = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{4}{3}.</me>
	This tells us the slope of the line <m>-x + 3y = -4</m> is <m>1/3</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
	For the second line, add <m>4x</m> to both sides
	<me>12y = 4x + 9,</me>
	divide both sides by <m>12</m>
	<me>y = \frac{4}{12}x + \frac{9}{12}</me>
	and reduce
	<me>y = \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{3}{4}.</me>
	This tells the slope of the line <m>-4x + 12y = 9</m> is also <m>1/3</m>.
	Therefore the lines <m>-x + 3y = -4</m> and <m>-4x + 12y = 9</m> are parallel by <xref ref="thm-parallel"/>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
	Find the equation of the line parallel to <m>4x + 2y = 9</m> that passes through the point <m>(-1,5)</m>.
	Write your answer in <xref ref="def-slope_intercept"/>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
	First, find the slope of the line <m>4x + 2y = 9</m> by placing the equation into <xref ref="def-slope_intercept" text="title"/>.
	Subtract <m>4x</m> from both sides
	<me>2y = -4x + 9,</me>
	divide both sides by <m>2</m>
	<me>y = -\frac{4}{2}x + \frac{9}{2}</me>
	and simplify to
	<me>y = -2x + \frac{9}{2}.</me>
	In this form, we see the slope of the line is <m>-2.</m>
      </p>
      <p>
	By <xref ref="thm-parallel"/>, the slope of a line parallel to <m>4x + 2y = 9</m> is <m>-2</m>.
	Now we use <xref ref="def-point_slope"/> to write down a line with slope <m>-2</m> through the point <m>(-1,5)</m>
	<me>y - 5 = -2(x - (-1))</me>
	and simplify
	<me>y - 5 = -2(x + 1).</me>
      </p>
      <p>
	Finally, to put this line into <xref ref="def-slope_intercept" text="title"/>, distribute the <m>-2</m>
	<me>y - 5 = -2x - 2,</me>
	add 5 to both sides of the equation
	<me>y = -2x -2 + 5,</me>
	and simplify
	<me>y = -2x + 3.</me>
      </p>
    </solution>
