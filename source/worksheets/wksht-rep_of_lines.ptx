      <introduction>
	<p>
	  You and a friend used the same parking garage.
	  You parked your car for 2 hours and it cost <m>\$12</m>.
	  Your friend parked her car for 4 hours and it cost <m>\$22</m>.
	</p>
      </introduction>
      <task workspace="1in">
	<p>
	  Let <m>x</m> represent the number of hours of parking and let <m>y</m> represent the cost.
	  Assuming the relationship is linear, how much does parking cost per hour?
