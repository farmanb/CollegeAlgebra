    <ul>
      <li>
	Identify if a function has <m>y</m>-axis symmetry.

      <li>
	Identify if a function has origin symmetry.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Functions with certain types of symmetry often have important properties.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  
  <definition>
    <p>
      A function <m>f</m> has <term><m>y</m>-axis symmetry</term>
      <idx>
	<h>Function</h>
	<h>Symmetry</h>
	<h><m>y</m>-axis</h>
      </idx>
      if for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      <me>f(-x) = f(x)</me>.
    </p>
  </definition>

  <p>
    As we have seen in <xref ref="sec-transformations"/>, the graph of <m>y = f(-x)</m> is obtained by reflecting the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis.
    Since a function with <m>y</m>-axis symmetry satisfies <m>f(-x) = f(x)</m>, this tells us that the portion of the graph on either side of the <m>y</m>-axis are mirror images of one another.
  </p>

  <example>
    <p>
      The function <m>f(x) = x^2</m> has <m>y</m>-axis syemmetry since
      <me>f(-x) = (-x)^2 = (-1)^2 x^2 = x^2 = f(x).</me>
      This tells us <xref ref="fig-parabola" text="title"/> is symmetric about the <m>y</m>-axis.
