  "body": " Symmetry    Identify if a function has -axis symmetry.  Identify if a function has origin symmetry.     Intuitively, an object is symmetric if there is some line that divides the object into two (or more) pieces that are mirror images of one another. In this section, we utilize the methods in to detect two types of symmetry mathematically.    Symmetry about the -axis   The first type of symmetry we are interested in is symmetry about the -axis in the plane. We begin with the intuitive understanding of this symmetry, and formalize a concrete method for detecting it algebraically.    We say a function has -axis symmetry   Function  Symmetry  -axis  if the -axis divides the graph into two pieces that are mirror images of one another.   For example, consider . The graph intersects the -axis at the point . If we cut the parabola in half at this point, then we get two pieces. We distinguish the two halves by coloring the left-hand side red and the right-hand side blue.      The graph of cut in half at .   To say these are mirror images of one another, means if we reflect the graph across the -axis, then we obtain the same graph just with the colors switched.      The reflection of across the -axis.   Had we not colored the two pieces, we would be unable to tell which one is which. We say the graph is invariant   Invariant  under reflection across the -axis to mean the original graph and its reflection across the -axis are the same. This observation allows us to rephrase in terms of reflections.    The function has -axis symmetry if it is invariant under reflection across the -axis.    The characterization of -axis symmetry above is purely geometric. Just like the intuitive understanding of symmetry, it can be difficult to verify whether two pictures are actually the same. Fortunately, the language of graph transformations provides us a dictionary between algebraic statements and geometric statements.    The function has -axis symmetry if for every in the domain of ,     The algebraic condition allows us to easily verify our intuition about images concretely.    Verify the function has -axis symmetry.    If we ask a utility like a graphing calculator to graph this function for us, we would see this function appears to be symmetric about the -axis.       To verify our intuition, we just need to check Therefore has -axis symmetry.      Origin Symmetry   The second type of symmetry we consider is slightly more subtle than -axis symmetry.    We say a function is symmetric about the origin   Function  Symmetry  Origin  if the graph of is invariant under rotation by 180 degrees.   To understand this type of symmetry, consider with the origin and another marked point.        We can see what happens as we rotate the graph around the origin in the animation below. Note the rotation does not change the shape of the graph, so the distance from the marked point to the origin stays the same.      Rotation of 180 degrees counter-clockwise   The path the marked point follows through the rotation traces out a piece of a circle. Plotting the entirety of this circle, we can see the starting and ending location of the marked point create a diameter.      The graph of with a marked point and the rotation of that point by   Assume the original point has coordinates and its rotation by has coordinates . Since the midpoint of the diameter is , we know that and . Solve the first equation for in terms of  The second coordinate is then Rewriting this in function notation, this tells us This provides us with an algebraic condition for testing origin symmetry.    The function has origin symmetry if for every in the domain of ,                        "

  "body": " Polynomial Functions   The simplest algebraic functions are constructed using the operations of addition and multiplication with a variable. While simple to construct, it is often difficult or even impossible to answer basic questions about these functions in general. However, these functions are extraordinarily important in nearly every branch of mathematics. We discuss foundational results about general polynomials in this section, and specialize to some easy to classify cases in the later sections.    Polynomial Function  A polynomial function   Function  Polynomial  of is a function of the form where is an integer, are numbers and .  We say is a polynomial of degree   Function  Polynomial  Degree   and write .     The numbers are called the coefficient   Function  Polynomial  Coefficient  of , respectively.    Roots of Polynomials  Polynomial functions are most interesting because they are relatively simple functions that allow us to model real world phenomena.   Assume an object is thrown straight up in the air. If we let denote the distance from the thrower's hand to the ground when the object is released, and let denote the velocity of the object in meters\/second as it leaves the thrower's hand, then the height of the object as a function of time can be expressed using the polynomial     How long will it take for the object to return to the hand of the thrower?   To answer this question, we want the solutions to the equation If we subtract from both sides of the equation, then it is equivalent to find solutions to the polynomial equation Questions of this type arise frequently when discussing polynomials.   Root A root   Function  Polynomial  Root  of the polynomial is a number, , such that   Questions about roots of polynomials have been posed and studied for millenia. One of the simplest questions asks whether we can find a formula that will produce the roots of a general polynomial of a certain degree in terms of its coefficients.   Is there a formula to find all of the roots of the polynomial in terms of the coefficients?   In general, the answer to this question is deeply unsatisfying. We will find formulas for polynomials of degree 1 in and of degree 2 in . While general formulas exist for polynomials of degree 3 and degree 4, they are beyond the scope of this text. However, there are no such general formulas for polynomials of degree 5 and higher. This means we will need to develop other techniques for finding roots of polynomials.   The Rational Root Theorem   Assume and are integers. If is a root of the polynomial then is a divisor of and is a divisor of .     Find all rational roots of .   The divisors of are and . The divisors of are , . tells us the only possible rational numbers that can be roots of are We can check each of these by evaluating the function at these rational numbers. Therefore the only rational roots of the polynomial are and .      Polynomial Division  Another method for finding roots that is often paired with is division. Recall that if we have an integer and a smaller integer, , then we can always find integers and with such that There is an analogous result for polynomials.   Polynomial Division   Assume and are polynomials with . There exist polynomials and with such that .  In analogy with the integers, we call the polynomials the dividend , the quotient , and the remainder , and we say that divided by is with remainder     For integers and , the process of finding and is often performed using long division.   To divide by , we would perform the long division using the symbols to find .   Another way to interpret the long division is to think about the base ten number system. The first step in long division is to find a string of digits in from left to right that is larger than . In this case, the first two digits form the number . The closest multiple of to 31 is , so we write a on top of the vinculum to signify this, subtract from to get and carry down the next digit, which is a . This is shorthand for writing   We repeat this process with and dividend . Again, the closest multiple of to is , so we write down another on top of the vinculum, subtract from to obtain , and carry down the . As before, this is shorthand for   The final step in the process is to perform the same operation with and dividend . As before, we can write         To arrive at the final answer, we can repeatedly replace the remainders to find   This process terminates because at each stage we are reducing the number of digits in the remainder by at least one. When we do long division with polynomials, our goal will be similar. Instead of reducing the number of digits, we reduce the degree by at least one.    Divide the polynomial by .    First we eliminate the term.   Next eliminate the term.   Finally, we can make the substitutions This tells us that divided by is .     Assume and are polynomials. The polynomial  divides   Function  Polynomial  Divides  the polynomial if the remainder in satisfies .     The number is a root of the polynomial if and only if divides .

In the previous section, we encountered linear functions and saw that we can express these functions in the form . When we graphed a linear function, we used to points to determine the line that represents the graph. We can reverse this process to find a linear function. The first step is to determine the slope. In doing this, we will find two other representations for lines.    The Slope of a Line through two Points   The Slope of a Line  The slope   Line  Slope  of the line through the points and is provided that . The slope measures the rate of change in with respect to , as depicted in .       The slope of the line through the points and .    In the definition of , we required that . While there is a line that passes through two distinct points with the same -coordinate, that line is a vertical line. Since a vertical line is not a function, the slope of a vertical line undefined.     Find the slope of the line through the points and .    The slope of the line through the points and is This says when the -coordinate increases by 1, the -coordinate decreases by 1.    Suppose we know the slope, , and a point that lines on the line. We can use the fact that is a to determine the -intercept. We substitute for and for in the and solve for :     The -intercept of the line with slope through the point is       Find the equation of the line through the points and .    In , we saw the slope of the line is . If we use the point , then we can find the -intercept by solving This tells us the equation of the line through and is .  We could also have used the point to find an equation of the line. If we use the point , then the -intercept is given by solving We can see that no matter which point we use, we obtain the same .      The Point-Slope Form of a Line  Assume we know the slope, , of a line and a point, , on the line. Suppose is any other point on the line. Since the slope of the line is constant, we can write to find the next form of a line.   The Point-Slope Form of a Line   The point-slope form of the line   Line  Point-Slope Form  through the point with slope is     This form of a line is convenient to use when we know the slope of a line and a point on the line.    Find the using the point and the slope .    Using , the equation of the line through with slope is       Find an equation for the line that passes through the points and .    We can use the to find the line between the points and . First compute the slope of the line Use either of the two points to find the equation   While these equations may look different, we can compare them by placing them in . For the first equation, add to both sides to get and for the second, add to both sides to get In this form, we can see that these equations represent the same line.      The Standard Equation of a Line  So far, we have only been interested in working with lines with a well-defined slope. Sometimes, it is convenient to work with lines that may be vertical. The standard equation of a line allows us to do just that.   Standard Equation of a Line  The standard equation of a line   Equation  Line  Standard  in the variables and is where and are not both zero.    Caution!  The standard equation of a line may not always represent an equation where is a function of ! If , then the standard equation of a line reduces to which is a vertical line.     Place the linear equation into .    The equation can be placed in standard form as follows. First, move the variables to the left-hand side of the equation. Subtract from both sides and distribute the negative Collect like terms and simplify Finally, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation and simplify to arrive at the standard form      Not all equations are linear. For example, the equation is not linear because of the term .     Representation of Lines    Determine the slope of a line through two points.

  "title": "Quadratic Functions",
  "body": " Quadratic Functions    Place a quadratic function in vertex form,  Find the vertex of a quadratic function,     In this section, we study polynomial functions of degree 2. These polynomial functions are often called quadratic functions .    Quadratic Function  A function is quadratic   Function  Quadratic  if it has the form where , , and are numbers, and .    Vertex Form   Just as with lines, quadratic functions are easier to understand through visualizations. The simplest quadratic function to understand is . We call the a parabola .  Graph  Parabola  The point is called the vertex .  Graph  Parabola  Vertex    As we have already seen in , the graph of this function is symmetric about the -axis, which is the vertical line through the vertex. While general quadratics are slightly more complicated, we can use the properties of to graph the class of quadratics in the following form.    The Vertex Form of a Quadratic  A quadratic function, , is in vertex form   Function  Quadratic  Vertex Form  if there are numbers and such that    Using the methods of , we can graph quadratics in this form by following the steps below.   Graphing Quadratic Functions in Vertex Form   To graph of the quadratic function      Translate the graph of horizontally by units.   If , then the translation is to the right.    If , then the translation is to the left.       Scale the graph of by .   If , then the graph is stretched.    If , then the graph is compressed.       If , reflect the graph of over the -axis.    Translate the graph of vertically by units.   If , then the translation is down.    If , then the translation is up.          Graph the function .    Following , we perform the following operations on the graph of the function .   Translate the graph of to the left by 1 to obtain the graph of .  Stretch the graph of by a factor of 2 to obtain the graph of .  Reflect the graph of across the -axis to obtain the graph of .  Translate the graph of up by 1 to obtain the graph of .   These operations are shown below.                   The transformations used to graph .     If we follow the vertex, we can see the first operation moves the point to . Since the point lies on the -axis, the second and third operation do not move the point . The fourth operation moves the point to the point . Since these operations preserve the general shape of the graph, a quadratic function in the form is a parabola with vertex at . Hence the reason for the name vertex form .  Similarly, if we follow the line of symmetry for , then we can see the first operation moves the vertical line to the vertical line . The following three operations do not change the vertical line, so the graph of is symmetric about the vertical line .  Finally, we observe the third operation may change the direction in which the parabola opens.   The graph of a parabola is    concave up   Function  Quadratic  Concave  Up  if the parabola opens upwards like .     concave down   Function  Quadratic  Concave  Down  if the parabola opens downwards like .      For quadratics in vertex form , we can see that is concave up whenever and concave down whenever .    Completing the Square   Surprisingly, every quadratic function can be placed into vertex form. Paired with the observations above, this tells us the graph of every quadratic function is a parabola. Placing a general quadratic function into vertex form will require the method of completing the square.   Remember that when we multiply two binomials, we must distribute. We can remember how to distribute using the mnemonic FOIL: F irst, O uter, I nner, L ast:   Multiplying binomials using the FOIL method.    If we use this method to multiply a binomial by itself, then we find the useful formula We call a quadratic function of the form a perfect square .  Perfect Square    Given a quadratic equation , we can use the formula to complete the square   Complete the Square  as follows.   Completing the Square  To complete the square with the quadratic function    Factor an from the first two terms to get   Add and subtract inside the parentheses to get   Factor the first three terms inside the parentheses as a perfect square   Distribute the through the sum          The number is the -coordinate of the vertex, and the number is the -coordinate of the vertex.   The Vertex Formula   Let be a quadratic function. The -coordinate of the vertex is and the -coordinate of the vertex is   As an ordered pair, the vertex of the graph of occurs at      Using , the vertex form of the quadratic function is      Find the vertex form of the quadratic function .    The -coordinate of the vertex is and the -coordinate of the vertex is Therefore the vertex form of the quadratic function       Find the vertex of the quadratic function .    The -coordinate of the vertex is and the -coordinate of the vertex is   Therefore the vertex form of the quadratic function is       The Quadratic Formula   In order to accurately graph a quadratic function , it is necessary to identify the -intercepts for the function. A point in the Cartesian plane is an for this function if This reduces the geometric problem of finding the -intercepts of a quadratic to the algebraic problem finding solutions to equations.    An equation of the form is called a quadratic equation   Equation  Quadratic     To find the solutions to the quadratic equation , we use to write and solve this equation for    It is important to note that are real numbers only when is a non-negative number. The number is an important invariant of a quadratic function.   The Discriminant  The discriminant   Function  Quadratic  Discriminant  of the quadratic function is the number    The discriminant provides both algebraic and geometric information about quadratic functions. On the algebraic side, the discriminant tells us how many solutions there are to the quadratic equation .   The Quadratic Formula   The quadratic equation has either two, one, or zero real solutions, depending on , .   If , then the two solutions are    If , then the only solution is   If , then there are no real solutions.      On the geometric side, the discriminant tells us how many -intercepts the graph of has.   The -intercepts of a Quadratic Function  The quadratic function has either two, one, or zero -intercepts, depending on the , .   If , then there are two -intercepts,    If , then there is one -intercept Note this is the vertex.  If , then there are no -intercepts.       Find the -intercepts of the function .    Since the discriminant is this function does not have any -intercepts.      Find the -intercepts of the function .    The discriminant of this quadratic is The solutions to the equation are given by the formula This tells us that one intercept occurs when and the other occurs when Therefore the -intercepts are       Graphing Qudaratics  We can simplify the process of graphing a quadratic function by using the tools we have developed in this section.   Graphing a Quadratic Function    Use the to find the vertex, , of the parabola. Plot the vertex in the plane.    Factor or use the to find the -intercept(s). If there are -intercepts, plot them in the plane.    Plot the -intercept, , in the plane.    Draw a parabola through the points in Steps (1) through (3).  The parabola will open upwards if .  The parabola will open downwards if .         Working with Quadratic Functions    find the vertex of a quadratic function,  find the -intercept(s) of a quadratic function  find the -intercept of a quadratic function,  graph a quadratic function.     Sketch a graph of each of the quadratic functions below. Label the -intercept, the vertex, and any -intercepts.                "
