    <p>
      In this section, we study the basics of relations and functions.

      A <term>relation</term>
      <idx>
	<h>Relation</h>

      is a set of ordered pairs of real numbers.
      The <term>domain</term>
      <idx>
	<h>Relation</h>

      is the set of second coordinates in the relation.

    <example>
      <p>
	Relations with only finitely many elements are easy to write down using <xref ref="def-roster_notation" text="title"/>.
	For example, 
	<me>\{(1, 2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8)\}</me>
	defines a relation.
	The domain of this relation is the set
	<me>D = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}</me>
	and the range of this relation is the set
	<me>R = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}.</me>
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <example>
      <p>
	Most of the relations we are interested in studying have infinitely many elements.
	Since we cannot write down all of the elements, we rely on <xref ref="def-set_builder_notation" text="title"/> to specify the relation.
	The relation
	<me>\left\{(x, x + 2) \;\middle\vert\; x \in \R \right\}</me>
	tells us the domain is the set, <m>\R</m>, of all real numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
	To find the range, we must determine which real numbers can be written as 2 more than another real number.
	We can see this is is all of <m>\R</m> because for every real number <m>y</m>, the real number <m>x = y - 2</m> satisfies 
	<me>x + 2 = (y - 2) + 2 = y</me>.
	Therefore the pair <m>(y - 2, y)</m> is an element of the relation.
