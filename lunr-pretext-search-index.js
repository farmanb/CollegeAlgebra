The Standard Form of a Circle  The standard form of a circle   Equation  Circle  Standard Form  with radius and center is     A diameter   Circle  Diameter  of a circle is a line that connects two points on the circle through the center. The length of a diameter of a circle of radius is , and the midpoint of the diameter is the center of the circle.   A diameter of the circle of radius centered at .         Completing the Square  Remember that when we multiply two binomials, we must distribute. We can remember how to distribute using the mnemonic FOIL: F irst, O uter, I nner, L ast:   How to multiply binomials using the FOIL method.    We can use this method to multiply a binomial by itself We call a trinomial of the form a perfect square .  Perfect Square    If we have a trinomial of the form , then we can use the formula to complete the square   Complete the Square  as follows.  Completing the Square   Factor an from the first two terms to get   Add and subtract inside the parentheses to get   Recognize the first three terms inside the parentheses as a perfect square   Distribute the in front through the sum to get        Complete the square with .    When the coefficient on is 1, we can skip the first step and the last step:       Complete the square with .    When the coefficient on is a negative number, such as , we can still use the formula by rewriting the subtraction as addition with a negative number.       Recognizing Circles  Sometimes, we will encounter the equation of a circle that is not in standard form. We can use twice to put it back into standard form. For example, consider the equation While this does not look like a circle, we can first complete the square in as follows. First, recognize . Add to both sides of the equation to obtain Rewrite the first three terms as a perfect square to obtain Next, we complete the square in . Adding to both sides yields Recognize the trinomial as a perfect square to find Finally, rewrite as and to arrive at the standard form of the circle Since these operations preserve the solutions to our equation, we can see that the equation represents the circle of radius centered at the point .   Working with Circles    Complete the square to put the equation of a circle into standard form.  Use the standard form of a circle to identify the center and radius.  Use the standard form of a circle to produce a graph.     Write down the equation of the circle of radius centered at .  Find the center and radius of the circle   Find the radius of the circle with center that passes through the point . Write the equation of this circle in standard form.
