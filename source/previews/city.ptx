    <title>Navigating a Foreign City</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
	Suppose you and a friend are visiting a foreign city.
	Neither of you can read the road signs, but you both brought a compass with you.
	You arrived the day before your friend, so you had an opportunity to explore and found some places you would like to visit.
	You have marked these locations on the map, relative to your hotel, which is marked with an <m>H</m>.
