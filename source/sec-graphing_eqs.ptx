  <introduction>
    <p>
      When two quantities vary together, the relationship is modeled by an equation in two variables.
      By convention, mathematicians use the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Often, it is convenient to visualize this relationship using a graph.

      to an equation in two variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, is an ordered pair <m>(a,b)</m> that make the equation true when
      <ol>
	<li>
	  the first coordinate, <m>a</m>, is substituted into the equation for <m>x</m>, and

	  the second coordinate, <m>b</m>, is substituted into the equation for <m>y</m>.

  <example>
    <p>
      Consider the equation <m>y = 2x - 2</m>.
      The ordered pair <m>(1,0)</m> is a solution to this equation because
      <me>0 = 2(1) - 2 = 2 - 2</me>
      is a true statement.
      The ordered pair <m>(3,5)</m> is <alert>not</alert> a solution to this equation because
      <me>5 = 2(3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4</me>
      is a false statement.

    <p>
      The graph of the equation <m>y = 2x - 2</m> is shown below.
      Coordinates for some of the points on this graph have been marked.
      In general, every point on this line has coordinates of the form <m>(x,2x - 2)</m>, where <m>x</m> can be any real number we choose.
