  <title>Polynomial Functions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The simplest algebraic functions are constructed using the operations of addition and multiplication with a variable.
      While simple to construct, it is often difficult or even impossible to answer basic questions about these functions in general.
      However, these functions are extraordinarily important in nearly every branch of mathematics.
      We discuss foundational results about general polynomials in this section, and specialize to some easy to classify cases in the later sections.

      Polynomial functions are most interesting because they are relatively simple functions that allow us to model real world phenomena.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
	Assume an object is thrown straight up in the air.
	If we let <m>h_0</m> denote the distance from the thrower's hand to the ground when the object is released, and let <m>v_0</m> denote the velocity of the object in meters/second as it leaves the thrower's hand, then the height of the object as a function of time can be expressed using the polynomial
	<me>h(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0.</me>
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <question>
      <p>
	How long will it take for the object to return to the hand of the thrower?
      </p>
    </question>

    <p>
      To answer this question, we want the solutions to the equation
      <me>-4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0 = h_0.</me>
      If we subtract <m>h_0</m> from both sides of the equation, then it is equivalent to find solutions to the polynomial equation
      <me>-4.9t^2 + v_0t = 0.</me>
      Questions of this type arise frequently when discussing polynomials.

    <p>
      Questions about roots of polynomials have been posed and studied for millenia.
      The most important result about roots of polynomials is the following.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-fundamental_theorem">
      <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
      <creator>Carl Friedrich Gauss</creator>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Given a polynomial <m>f</m> of degree <m>n > 0</m>, there exist a constant <m>c</m> and <m>n</m> roots <m>r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n</m> such that
	  <me>f(x) = c(x - r_1)(x - r_2) \cdots (x - r_n).</me>
	  We call this expression the <term>factorization</term>
	  <idx>
	    <h>Function</h>
	    <h>Polynomial</h>
	    <h>Factorization</h>
	  </idx>
	  of the polynomial <m>f</m>.
	  <!-- Every polynomial of degree <m>n > 0</m> has at least one root, which may be a complex number of the form -->
	  <!-- <m>a + bi = a + b\sqrt{-1}</m>. -->
	</p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <!-- <p> -->
    <!-- 	We make some important notes about the roots in <xref ref="thm-fundamental_theorem" text="title"/>. -->
    <!-- </p> -->
    <p>
      Up to the constant <m>c</m>, the factorization in <xref ref="thm-fundamental_theorem" text="title"/> is unique.
    </p>

    <example component="web">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The roots of the polynomial <m>f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1</m> are <m>r_1 = 1</m> and <m>r_2 = 1/2</m>.
	  Use this information to factor <m>f</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>
	  Knowing the two roots of <m>f</m> provides the factorization
          <me>f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 2(x-1)\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right).</me>
	  However, it is more convenient to distribute the <m>2</m> to the term <m>(x - 1/2)</m> and write
	  <me>f(x) = (x - 1)(2x - 1).</me>
      	  Even though these factorizations are not strictly identical, we consider these factorizations to be equivalent since they both convey that the roots of the polynomial <m>f</m> are <m>1</m> and <m>1/2</m>.
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <worksheet component="print">
      <title/>
      <page>
	<example>
	  <statement>
	    <p>
	      The roots of the polynomial <m>f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1</m> are <m>r_1 = 1</m> and <m>r_2 = 1/2</m>.
	      Use this information to factor <m>f</m>.
	    </p>
	  </statement>
	</example>
      </page>
    </worksheet>
    
    <p>
      Another important observation is the roots in the list <m>r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n</m> may not necessarily be distinct.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Assume <m>f</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> and <m>r</m> is a root of <m>f</m>.
	  The <term>multiplicity</term> of <m>r</m>, is the number of times of times <m>r</m> appears in the factorization of <m>f</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example component="web">
      <statement>
	<p>

      </statement>
      <solution>

	  </md>
	  has roots <m>r_1 = -1</m>, <m>r_2 = -1</m>, and <m>r_3 = 1</m>.
	  We say the root <m>x = 1</m> has multiplicity <m>1</m> and the root <m>x = -1</m> has multiplicity <m>2</m>.
	  This allows us to say that the polynomial <m>f</m> has three roots counting multiplicity.
	</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Finally, we note the roots of a polynomial may not always be real numbers.
      For example, the polynomial <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m> does not have any real roots because every real number, <m>r</m>, satisfies <m>r^2 \geq 0</m> and thus
      <me>f(r) = r^2 + 1 \geq 0 + 1 = 1.</me>

      <statement>
	<p>
	  <term>The Imaginary Unit</term>
	  The <term>imaginary unit</term>, <m>i</m>, is defined to be one of the roots of the polynomial <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m>.
	  In particular, <m>i^2 + 1 = 0</m> or, equivalently, <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
	  It is common to write <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Since
      <me>(-i)^2 + 1= (-1)^2 i^2 + 1= i^2 + 1 = 0</me>
      the roots <m>i</m> and <m>-i</m> provide the factorization
      <me>x^2 + 1 = (x - i)(x + i).</me>
      Numbers that involve <m>i</m> arise frequently in the study of roots of polynomials of degree 2.

      It is important to note <xref ref="thm-fundamental_theorem" text="title"/> tells us that every polynomial of degree <m>n</m> has precisely <m>n</m> roots (counting multiplicities), some of which may not be real numbers.
      However, it does <alert>not</alert> tell us <em>how</em> to find those roots.
    </p>
    
    <question>
      <p>
	Is there a formula to find all of the roots of the polynomial <m>f(x) = a_nx^n + \cdots + a_0</m> in terms of the coefficients?
      </p>
    </question>

    <p>
      In general, the answer to this question is deeply unsatisfying.
      We will find formulas for roots of polynomials of degree 1 in <xref ref="sec-linear_functions"/> and of degree 2 in <xref ref="sec-quadratic_functions"/>.
      While formulas exist for roots of polynomials of <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation#General_cubic_formula">degree <m>3</m></url> and <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_equation#The_general_case">degree <m>4</m></url>, they are beyond the scope of this text.
      However, there are no such general formulas for polynomials of degree 5 and higher.
      This means we will need to develop other techniques for finding roots of polynomials.
      One very useful tool for finding roots of general polynomials is the rational root theorem.
