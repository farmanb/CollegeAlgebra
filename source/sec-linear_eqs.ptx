      A <term>linear equation</term>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
	Place the linear equation
	<me>x + 3y - 2x + 7 = 5 + y - 4x</me>
	into <xref ref="def-linear_equation"/>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
	The equation
	<me>x + 3y - 2x + 7 = 5 + y - 4x</me>
	can be placed in standard form as follows.
	First, move the variables to the left-hand side of the equation.
	Subtract <m>y - 4x</m> from both sides
	<me>x - 2x + 3y + 7 - (y - 4x) = 5</me>
	and distribute the negative
	<me>x - 2x + 3y + 7 - y + 4x = 5.</me>
	Collect like terms
	<me>x - 2x + 4x + 3y - y + 7 = 5</me>
	and simplify
	<me>3x + 2y + 7 = 5.</me>
	Finally, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation
	<me>3x + 4y = 5 - 7</me>
	and simplify to arrive at the standard form
	<me>3x + 4y = -2.</me>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <example>
    <p>
      Not all equations are linear.
      For example, the equation <m>xy + y - 7 = 2</m> is not linear because of the term <m>xy</m>.
    </p>

    <title>Graphing Linear Equations</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
	Recall that the <xref ref="def-graph" text="title"/> of an equation consists of all points <m>(x,y)</m> that are a <xref ref="def-solution" text="title"/> to the equation.
	The graph of a linear equation is always a line.
	We can graph the equation by finding any two points on the line and drawing a line through them.
      </p>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Horizontal Lines</title>
      <p>
	If <m>a = 0</m> and <m>b \neq 0</m>, then the standard form is <m>by = c</m>.
	Dividing both sides of the equation by <m>b</m> allows us to write
	<me>y = \frac{c}{b}.</me>
	The solutions to this equation are points of the form <m>\left(x, \frac{c}{b}\right)</m>, where <m>x</m> is allowed to be <em>any</em> real number.
	The graph of this equation is a horizontal line.
      </p>

      <example>
	<statement>
	  <p>
	    Graph the linear equation <m>y = 0</m>.
	  </p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
	  <p>
	    The solutions to the linear equation <m>y = 0</m> have the form <m>(x, 0)</m>, where <m>x</m> is allowed to be any real number.
	    The graph of this equation forms the <m>x</m>-axis in the Cartesian plane.

      <p>
	When <m>a \neq 0</m> and <m>b \neq 0</m>, we can graph the equation <m>ax + by = c</m> by finding any two points and drawing a line through them.
	There are always two simple points we can find on the line.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-x_intercept">
	The <term><m>x</m>-intercept</term>
	<idx>
	  <h>Equation</h>
	  <h>Linear</h>
	  <h><m>x</m>-intercept</h>
	</idx>
	the line <m>ax + by = c</m> is the point where the line intersects the <m>x</m>-axis.
      </definition>

      <p>
	Every point on the <m>x</m>-axis has the form <m>(x,0)</m>.
	By substituting 0 for <m>y</m> in the equation <m>ax + by = c</m> we get the equation
	<me>c = ax + 0y = ax.</me>
	Dividing both sides by <m>a</m> tells us the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the <m>x</m>-intercept is
	<me>x = \frac{c}{a}.</me>
      </p>

      <example>
	<statement>
	  <p>
	    Find the <m>x</m>-intercept of the linear equation <m>2x + 3y = 5</m>.

	</statement>
	<solution>
	  <p>
	    To find the <m>x</m>-intercept of the linear equation <m>2x + 3y = 6</m>, we substitute <m>0</m> for <m>y</m> to get
	    <me>2x = 6.</me>
	    To solve for <m>x</m>, we divide both sides by <m>2</m> to see that <M>x = 3</M>.
	    Therefore the <m>x</m>-intercept of the linear equation <m>2x + 3y = 6</m> is the point <m>(3,0)</m>.
