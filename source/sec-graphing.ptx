  <title>Graphing in the Plane</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When two quantities vary together, the relationship is modeled by an equation in two variables.
      By convention, mathematicians use the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

    <p>
      The <term>graph</term> of an equation in the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are the points in the plane that make the equation true when
      <ol>
	<li>
	  the first coordinate is substituted into the equation for <m>x</m>, and
	</li>
	<li>
	  the second coordinate is substituted into the equation for <m>y</m>.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <p>
      Consider the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>.
      The point <m>(1,5)</m> is on the graph of equation because the equation
      <me>5 = 2(1) + 3 = 2 + 3</me>
      is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point <m>(3,3)</m> is not on the graph of the equation because
      <me>3 = 2(3) + 3 = 9</me>
      is not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      More generally, the graph of the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m> consists of all points of the form
      <m>(x, 2x + 3)</m>.
