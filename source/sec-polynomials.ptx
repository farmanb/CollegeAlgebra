  <title>Polynomial Functions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The simplest algebraic functions are constructed using the operations of addition and multiplication with a variable.
      While simple to construct, it is often difficult or even impossible to answer basic questions about these functions in general.
      However, these functions are extraordinarily important in nearly every branch of mathematics.
      We discuss foundational results about general polynomials in this section, and specialize to some easy to classify cases in the later sections.

    <title>Roots of Polynomials</title>

    <p>
      Polynomial functions are most interesting because they are relatively simple functions that allow us to model real world phenomena.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
	Assume an object is thrown straight up in the air.
	If we let <m>h_0</m> denote the distance from the thrower's hand to the ground when the object is released, and let <m>v_0</m> denote the velocity of the object in meters/second as it leaves the thrower's hand, then the height of the object as a function of time can be expressed using the polynomial
	<me>h(t) = -4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0.</me>
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <question>
      <p>
	How long will it take for the object to return to the hand of the thrower?
      </p>
    </question>

    <p>
      To answer this question, we want the solutions to the equation
      <me>-4.9t^2 + v_0t + h_0 = h_0.</me>
      If we subtract <m>h_0</m> from both sides of the equation, then it is equivalent to find solutions to the polynomial equation
      <me>-4.9t^2 + v_0t = 0.</me>
      Questions of this type arise frequently when discussing polynomials.
    </p>
    
    <definition>
      <title>Root</title>
      A <term>root</term>
      <idx>
	<h>Function</h>
	<h>Polynomial</h>
	<h>Root</h>
      </idx>
      of the polynomial
      <me>f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0</me>
      is a number, <m>r</m>, such that
      <me>0 = f(r) = a_nr^n + a_{n-1}r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 r + a_0.</me>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Questions about roots of polynomials have been posed and studied for millenia.
      One of the simplest questions asks whether we can find a formula that will produce the roots of a general polynomial of a certain degree in terms of its coefficients.
    </p>
    
    <question>
      <p>
	Is there a formula to find all of the roots of the polynomial <m>f(x) = a_nx^n + \cdots + a_0</m> in terms of the coefficients?
      </p>
    </question>

    <p>
      In general, the answer to this question is deeply unsatisfying.
      We will find formulas for polynomials of degree 1 in <xref ref="sec-linear_functions"/> and of degree 2 in <xref ref="sec-quadratic_functions"/>.
      While general formulas exist for polynomials of degree 3 and degree 4, they are beyond the scope of this text.
      However, there are no such general formulas for polynomials of degree 5 and higher.
      This means we will need to develop other techniques for finding roots of polynomials.

	  Assume <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are integers.

	  <me>f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0,</me>

	  The divisors of <m>2</m> are <m>\pm 2</m> and <m>\pm 1</m>.

	  <xref ref="thm-rational_root" text="title"/> tells us the only possible rational numbers that can be roots of <m>f</m> are
	  <me>\pm 3,\, \pm \frac{3}{2},\, \pm 1,\,\text{and}\ \pm\frac{1}{2}.</me>
	  We can check each of these by evaluating the function at these rational numbers.

  <subsection>
    <title>Polynomial Division</title>
    <p>
      Another method for finding roots that is often paired with <xref ref="thm-rational_root" text="title"/> is division.
      Recall that if we have an integer <m>n</m> and a smaller integer, <m>d</m>, then we can always find integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> with <m>r \lt d</m> such that
      <me>n = qd + r.</me>
      There is an analogous result for polynomials.
    </p>
    
    <theorem xml:id="thm-polynomial_division">
      <title>Polynomial Division</title>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Assume <m>f</m> and <m>d</m> are polynomials with <m>\deg{d} \lt \deg{f}</m>.
	  There exist polynomials <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> with <m>\deg{r} \lt \deg{d}</m> such that
	  <me>f(x) = q(x)d(x) + r(x)</me>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In analogy with the integers, we call the polynomials <m>d</m> the <term>dividend</term>, <m>q</m> the <term>quotient</term>, and <m>r</m> the <term>remainder</term>, and 
	  we say that <m>f</m> divided by <m>d</m> is <m>q</m> with remainder <m>r</m>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      For integers <m>n</m> and <m>d</m>, the process of finding <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> is often performed using long division.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
	To divide <m>3135</m> by <m>7</m>, we would perform the long division using the symbols
	<md>
	  <mrow>  \amp\phantom{)3}447</mrow>
	  <mrow>7 \amp\overline{\smash{)}{3135}} </mrow>
	  <mrow> \amp \underline{-28}</mrow>
	  <mrow> \amp \phantom{-2}33</mrow>
	  <mrow> \amp \phantom{2}\underline{-28}</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp \phantom{-28}55</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp \phantom{28}\underline{-49}</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp \phantom{)3135}6</mrow>
	</md>
	to find <m>3135 = 447(7) + 6</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
    
    <p>
      Another way to interpret the long division is to think about the base ten number system.
      The first step in long division is to find a string of digits in <m>3135</m> from left to right that is larger than <m>7</m>.
      In this case, the first two digits form the number <m>31</m>.
      The closest multiple of <m>7</m> to 31 is <m>4 \times 7 = 28</m>, so we write a <m>4</m> on top of the vinculum to signify this, subtract <m>28</m> from <m>31</m> to get <m>3</m> and carry down the next digit, which is a <m>3</m>.
      This is shorthand for writing
      <me>3135 = 400 \times 7 + 335.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We repeat this process with <m>335</m> and dividend <m>7</m>.
      Again, the closest multiple of <m>7</m> to <m>33</m> is <m>28 = 4 \times 7</m>, so we write down another <m>4</m> on top of the vinculum, subtract <m>28</m> from <m>33</m> to obtain <m>5</m>, and carry down the <m>5</m>.
      As before, this is shorthand for
      <me>
	335 = 40 \times 7 + 55.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The final step in the process is to perform the same operation with <m>55</m> and dividend <m>7</m>.
      As before, we can write
      <me>55 = 49 + 6 = 7 \times 7 + 6.</me>
    </p>
      <!-- <md> -->
      <!-- 	<mrow>3135 \amp= 400(7) + 335</mrow> -->
      <!-- 	<mrow>335 \amp = 40(7) + 55</mrow> -->
      <!-- 	<mrow>55 \amp = 7(7) + 6.</mrow> -->
      <!-- </md> -->
      <!-- At each stage, our goal is to reduce the number of digits in the remainder by at least one. -->
      <p>
	To arrive at the final answer, we can repeatedly replace the remainders to find
      <md>
	<mrow>3135 \amp = 400 \times 7 + 335</mrow>
	<mrow>\amp = 400 \times 7 + (40 \times 7 + 55)</mrow>
	<mrow>\amp = 400 \times 7 + 40 \times 7 + 55</mrow>
	<mrow>\amp = 400 \times 7 + 40 \times 7 + (7 \times 7 + 6)</mrow>
	<mrow>\amp = (400 + 40 + 7) \times 7 + 6</mrow>
	<mrow>\amp = 447 \times 7 + 6.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This process terminates because at each stage we are reducing the number of digits in the remainder by at least one.
      When we do long division with polynomials, our goal will be similar.
      Instead of reducing the number of digits, we reduce the degree by at least one.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Divide the polynomial <m>f(x) = x^3 - 1</m> by <m>d(x) = x - 1</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>
	  First we eliminate the <m>x^3</m> term.
	  <md>
	    <mrow>\amp x^3 - 1 - x^2(x - 1) = x^2 - 1 \amp\amp \text{Subtract}\ x^2(x-1)\ \text{from}\ f(x)</mrow>
	    <mrow>\amp x^3 - 1 = x^2(x-1) + x^2 - 1 \amp\amp \text{Add}\ x^2(x-1)\ \text{from both sides}</mrow>
	  </md>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Next eliminate the <m>x^2</m> term.
	  <md>
	    <mrow>\amp x^2 - 1 - x(x-1) = x - 1 \amp\amp \text{Subtract}\ x(x-1)\ \text{from}\ x^2 - 1</mrow>
	    <mrow>\amp x^2 - 1 = x(x - 1) + x - 1\amp\amp \text{Subtract}\ x(x - 1)\ \text{from both sides}</mrow>
	  </md>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Finally, we can make the substitutions
	  <md>
	    <mrow>x^3 - 1 \amp= x^2(x - 1) + (x^2 - 1)</mrow>
	    <mrow>\amp = x^2(x - 1) + x(x - 1) + (x-1)</mrow>
	    <mrow>\amp = (x^2 + x + 1)(x - 1).</mrow>
	  </md>
	  This tells us that <m>x^3 - 1</m> divided by <m>x-1</m> is <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
