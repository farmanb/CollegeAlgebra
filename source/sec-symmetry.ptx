  <introduction>
    <p>
      Intuitively, an object is <em>symmetric</em> if there is some line that divides the object into two (or more) pieces that are mirror images of one another.
      In this section, we utilize the methods in <xref ref="sec-transformations"/> to detect two types of symmetry mathematically.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Symmetry about the <m>y</m>-axis</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
	The first type of symmetry we are interested in is symmetry about the <m>y</m>-axis in the plane.
	We begin with the intuitive understanding of this symmetry, and formalize a concrete method for detecting it algebraically.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <definition xml:id="def-y_axis_symmetry">
      <p>
	We say a function <m>f</m> has <term><m>y</m>-axis symmetry</term>
	<idx>
	  <h>Function</h>
	  <h>Symmetry</h>
	  <h><m>y</m>-axis</h>
	</idx>
	if the <m>y</m>-axis divides the graph into two pieces that are mirror images of one another.
      </p>
    </definition>
    
    <p>
      For example, consider <xref ref="fig-parabola" text="title"/>.
      The graph intersects the <m>y</m>-axis at the point <m>(0,0)</m>.
      If we cut the parabola in half at this point, then we get two pieces.
      We distinguish the two halves by coloring the left-hand side red and the right-hand side blue.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image>
	<latex-image>
	  \begin{tikzpicture}
	  \def\a{0}
	  \draw [color=blue,thick] plot[smooth,samples=500,domain=\a:\a+2] (\x,{(\x-\a)^2});
	  \draw [color=red,thick] plot[smooth,samples=500,domain=-\a-2:-\a] (\x,{(\x + \a)^2});

	  \end{tikzpicture}
	</latex-image>
      </image>
      <caption>The graph of <m>y = x^2</m> cut in half at <m>(0,0)</m>.</caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      To say these are mirror images of one another, means if we reflect the graph across the <m>y</m>-axis, then we obtain the same graph just with the colors switched.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image>
	<latex-image>
	  \begin{tikzpicture}
	  \def\a{0}
	  \draw [color=red,thick] plot[smooth,samples=500,domain=\a:\a+2] (\x,{(\x-\a)^2});
	  \draw [color=blue,thick] plot[smooth,samples=500,domain=-\a-2:-\a] (\x,{(\x + \a)^2});
	  \end{tikzpicture}
	</latex-image>
      </image>
      <caption>The reflection of <m>y = x^2</m> across the <m>y</m>-axis.</caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Had we not colored the two pieces, we would be unable to tell which one is which.
      We say the graph is <term>invariant</term>
      <idx>
	<h>Invariant</h>
      </idx>
      under reflection across the <m>y</m>-axis to mean the original graph and its reflection across the <m>y</m>-axis are the same.
      This observation allows us to rephrase <xref ref="def-y_axis_symmetry"/> in terms of reflections.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The function <m>f</m> has <m>y</m>-axis symmetry if it is invariant under reflection across the <m>y</m>-axis.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The characterization of <m>y</m>-axis symmetry above is purely geometric.
      Just like the intuitive understanding of symmetry, it can be difficult to verify whether two pictures are actually the same.
      Fortunately, the language of graph transformations provides us a dictionary between algebraic statements and geometric statements.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The function <m>f</m> has <m>y</m>-axis symmetry if for every <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>,
	  <me>f(-x) = f(x).</me>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      The algebraic condition allows us to easily verify our intuition about images concretely.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Verify the function <m>f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 4</m> has <m>y</m>-axis symmetry.
	</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
	<p>
	  If we ask a utility like a graphing calculator to graph this function for us, we would see this function appears to be symmetric about the <m>y</m>-axis.
	</p>

	      \begin{tikzpicture}
	      \path [draw, help lines, opacity=.5]  (-3,-3) grid (4,4);

	      \end{tikzpicture}
	    </latex-image>
	  </image>
	</figure>
	<p>
	  To verify our intuition, we just need to check
	  <md>
	    <mrow>f(-x) \amp= (-x)^4 - 5(-x)^2 + 4</mrow>
	    <mrow>\amp = (-1)^4x^4 - 5(-1)^2x^2 + 4</mrow>
	    <mrow>\amp = x^4 - 5x^2 + 4</mrow>
	    <mrow>\amp = f(x).</mrow>
	  </md>
	  Therefore <m>f(x)</m> has <m>y</m>-axis symmetry.

  <subsection>
    <title>Origin Symmetry</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
	The second type of symmetry we consider is slightly more subtle than <m>y</m>-axis symmetry.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <definition>
      <p>
	We say a function <m>f</m> is <term>symmetric about the origin</term>
	<idx>
	  <h>Function</h>
	  <h>Symmetry</h>
	  <h>Origin</h>
	</idx>
	if the graph of <m>f</m> is invariant under rotation by 180 degrees.
      </p>
    </definition>
    <p>
      To understand this type of symmetry, consider <xref ref="fig-cubic" text="title"/> with the origin and another marked point.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image>
	<latex-image>
	  \begin{tikzpicture}

	  \path [draw, help lines, opacity=.5]  (-4,-4) grid (4,4);

	  \draw [very thick,->] (-4,0) -- (4+.2,0) node [anchor=south] {$x$};
	  \draw [very thick,->] (0,-4) -- (0,4+.2) node [anchor=west] {$y$};

      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      First, we rotate the graph by 90 degrees.
      We note that this rotation does not change the shape of the graph, so the distance of our marked point from the origin should not change.
    </p>

      <caption>The graph of <m>y=x^3</m> rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.</caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Rotating once more by 90 degrees, we still have not changed the distance of our marked point from the origin.
      The graph looks the same, except we have moved our marked point from the first quadrant into the third quadrant.

      <caption>The graph of <m>y=x^3</m> rotated 180 degrees counter-clockwise.</caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Since the rotated point is the same distance away from the origin as our original point, these two points must lie on the same circle.
      Moreover, a line connecting these points through the origin will give us a diameter.

      <caption>The graph of <m>y=x^3</m> with a marked point and the rotation of that point by <m>180^\circ</m></caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Assume the original point has coordinates <m>(a,a^3)</m> and its rotation by <m>180^\circ</m> has coordinates <m>(b,b^3)</m>.
      Since the midpoint of the diameter is <m>(0,0)</m>, we know that <m>0 = (a+b)/2</m> and <m>0 = (a^3 + b^3)/2</m>.
      Solve the first equation for <m>b</m> in terms of <m>a</m>
      <md>
	<mrow>0 \amp= \frac{a + b}{2} \amp\amp \text{Multiply both sides by 2}</mrow>
	<mrow>0 \amp= a + b \amp\amp \text{Subtract}\ a\ \text{from both sides}</mrow>
	<mrow>b \amp= -a.</mrow>
      </md>
      The second coordinate is then
      <me>b^3 = (-a)^3 = (-1)^3 a^3 = -a^3.</me>
      Rewriting this in function notation, this tells us 
      <me>f(-a) = (-a)^3 = -a^3 = -f(a).</me>
      This provides us with an algebraic condition for testing origin symmetry.
